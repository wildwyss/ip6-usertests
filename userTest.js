/**
 * In this project we have built a set of functions to produce and transform lazy sequences.
 * A lazy sequence is a sequence of values that never fully materializes in memory.
 * Therefore, lazy sequences can provide a large - even infinite - amount of values.
 *
 * Such sequences can be created using a constructor, taking three values:
 * 1. An initial value, which is the first value to be held by this sequence
 * 2. An "until" function, which decides whether further elements can be generated.
 *    The "until" function takes the current value as its parameter and returns
 *    true if the sequence should proceed, false if not.
 * 3. An incrementation function, which defines how the next value is calculated based on the current value.
 *
 * In the following we ask you to solve small exercises based on lazy sequences.
 *
 */

/**
 *
 * Please have a look at this simple example of such a lazy sequence, which produces the values from 0 to 100.
 *
 * _Note 1:_ The lazy sequence module is imported as {@link _}. This way you can easily access all operators on
 *           sequences using `_.`; For example: to call the function "map" just use
 *           `const mapped = _.map(x => 2*x)([1,2,3,4,5]);`.
 *           hint: Operations defined for sequences (such as `map`) can be used on any standard JavaScript {@link Iterable}.
 *           That means that you can also use them to transform any standard JS arrays, HTMLCollections and so on.
 *
 * _Note 2:_ Since sequences are lazy, there is no direct element access on a sequence.
 *           But you can easily deconstruct a sequence using the `...`-operator.
 *           In our previously mapped values just use `console.log(...mapped);` to log all values of the
 *           sequence to the console.
 *
 * _Note 3:_ Pay attention with infinite iterators, as they, when deconstructed, try to eagerly evaluate each element of
 *           the sequence. This will go on forever and your browser will not respond anymore. Use {@link _.take} to only
 *           evaluate a certain amount of values.
 *
 * @type { SequenceType<Number> }

 * _Note:_ use {@link _.map} to map the function {@link slope} over the halves!

 * Conclusion:
 * With lazy sequences it is very easy to calculate slopes of functions with arbitrary accuracy.

 * Imagine you don't want to halve the original h0 but quarter it with each step. To do this, simply
 * modify the implementation of differentiate without changing any other code!
 * You can even integrate by reusing the sequence {@link halves} and the function {@link within}.

 * Congratulation, you solved the first part of the user-tests successfully.

 * Content of the following section:
 * 1. JINQ - available functions
 * 2. Examine some examples and learn from it
 * 3. It's your turn - solving exercises
 */

// ------------------------------------------------  JINQ  -------------------------------------------------------------

/**
 * Having a closer look at JINQ.
 * With JINQ, you can process lists and other data sources in a fluent way as if you were working with database queries.
 * Suppose, you want to filter a list of animals to find all dolphins. We can do it as follows:
 *
 * from(animals)
 *   .select(x => x['type'])
 *   .where(type => type === 'dolphin')
 *   .result();
 *
 * What is happening here?
 * from:   Takes a data source and adds further functionality to it.
 * select: For each element, we map it to its object-property 'type', so now it's a list of animal types (you can also
 *         use map for this).
 * where:  It works like a filter, we're taking only the elements which match the given predicate.
 * result: Returns a new datasource based on the previous operations.
 *
 * More JINQ functions:
 * inside:    Applies a function `f` to each element. `f` turns the element in a new JINQ compatible data source.
 * pairWith:  The elements of the current data source are combined with a new JINQ compatible data source.
 *            As result, we get all combinations of both datasets in pairs.
 *
 * If you are facing some troubles, look at our implementation and its test-file, this may help you.
 * => Kolibri/contrib/wild_wyss/src/jinq/
 *
 * Working with pairs:
 * A pair represents an immutable data structure holding exactly two values.
 *
 * Create a pair using the following syntax:
 * const pair = Pair("first")("second");
 *
 * The values from a pair can be received using:
 * const value1 = fst(pair);
 * const value2 = snd(pair);
 *
 * ... or in a nicer way:
 * const [value1, value2] = pair;
 */

/**
 * JSONMonad
 *
 * A great thing about JINQ is, that it can easily be used to process any lists of JavaScript objects.
 * For this reason, such a list must be wrapped with the constructor {@link JsonMonad}.
 * A JsonMonad is an {@link Iterable iterable object}, which, when iterating, returns element after element of the
 * underlying list.
